                    [X] Create client.js file
                    [X] Create jQuery.js file
                [X] Create index.html file
            [X] Create server.js file
        [ ] Run commands from terminal
            [ ] npm init --yes
            [ ] npm install express
    [ ] Create user interface where user can input two values
    [ ] Create 4 buttons with + - * / selections
    [ ] Create an = button
        [ ] Captures input
        [ ] Bundles input up into object
        [ ] Sends object to the server via POST
    [ ] Create a "C" button
        [ ] Clears the input fields
    [ ] Build out server-side logic to compute the numbers
    [ ] Send back "OK" when calculation is complete
    [ ] GET request after the POST to get the actual calculation
    [ ] Keep a historical record of all solutions on the server
        [ ] Display a list of all previous calculations when pages loads using a GET request
        [ ] Update the list when a new calculation is made
        **history should exist even after refreshing the page... it's expected that the
        history will go away after restarting the server**
